# HXL hashtag chooser Telegram BOT
A simple and stupid Telegram BOT that uses Artificial Intelligence to select the best HXL tag for your project.

This Telegram BOT is an application of an expert system, which is software that has the function of simulating the knowledge of an expert in a very specific area. This expert system was based on a json-encoded knowledge HXL base.

The  [Humanitarian Exchange Language](http://hxlstandard.org/)  (HXL) is a simple, hashtag-based standard that humanitarian-crisis responders can use to add interoperable information to spreadsheets and similar data. The responses generated by this script is an interactive chooser that helps IM workers to choose the most-accurate and interoperable hashtags.

The latest chooser is available online at
